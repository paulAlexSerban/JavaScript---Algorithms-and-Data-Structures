# Data Structures

- data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
- different data structures excel at different things - some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally ued

## Why care?
- the more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you will need to use one of these data structures
- you have already worked with many data structures unknowingly
