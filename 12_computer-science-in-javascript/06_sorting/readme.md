# Sorting

- very important in the Computer Science topic

## What is it?

- sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (eg. an array) so that hte items are in some kind of order
  - sorting numbers from smallest to largest
  - sorting names alphabetically
  - sorting movies base on release year
  - sorting movies based on revenue

## Why do we need to learn sorting?

- sorting is a very common task - ao it is good to know how it works
- there are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have theirs own advantages and disadvantages

## Big of Basic Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble Sort
  - BEST - time complexity - `O(n)`
  - AVERAGE - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - WORST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - Space complexity - `O(1)`
### Insertion Sort
  - BEST - time complexity - `O(n)`
  - AVERAGE - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - WORST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - Space complexity - `O(1)`
### Selection Sort
  - BEST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - AVERAGE - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - WORST - time complexity - `O(n^2)`
  - Space complexity - `O(1)`

## Basic Sorting algorithms recap
- sorting is fundamental
- bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are roughly relevant
- all have average time complexities that are quadratic
- we can do better ... but we need more complex algorithms
