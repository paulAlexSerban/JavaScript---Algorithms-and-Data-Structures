# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms
## Why learn these?
- the basic sorting algorithms do not scale well
- these intermediate algorithms are are much faster, but also more challenging, and less intuitive to write on your own
- try out a bubble sort on an  of 10000 elements, it will take some time

## Faster sorts
- there is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n log n)`
- there is a tradeoff between efficient and simplicity
- the more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
